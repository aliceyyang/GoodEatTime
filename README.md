## About Good Eat Time
As the covid pandemic heats up, the catering industry is bearing the brunt of the impact. In response to the rapidly rising demand for frozen-prepared-foods and 
the gradually rising number of reservations after Taiwan is gradually lifting lockdowns, we have built an ecommerce platform - Good Eat Time that provides features such as search, reservation, and online shopping.
  
**The two main aspects of the platform:**
1. Assisting restaurants and caterers:
	-	Automatic reserve notification – reduce reservation mistakes caused by human error, also can reduce consumer no-shows by reminding them
	-	Real-time updates – accurate map positioning, up-to-date restaurant info and reservation rules
	-	Increase brand exposure – Restaurants can scale their offline business by going online through our platform, and place advertisements on the homepage to increase exposure and reach out to more potential customers.
2.	Provide consumers with:
	-	Great customer experience – By helping restaurants start with a digital transformation strategy, customers can change membership, orders, reservations, comments and other information at any time. Reducing the cumbersome process of actual communication in the past and improving efficiency. We are aimed to provide efficient, smooth, and enjoyable customer experience!
	-	Great discounts – Our platform provides restaurants with coupons to retain consumers and save customers’ money at the same time, creating a win-win situation!
